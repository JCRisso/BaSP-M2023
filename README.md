# BaSP 2023. Week 1 and 2
Brief description of what was worked on the project in the Week 1 and 2

## WEEK 1
```
In the first week we learned te basics of web developement, the sections of a web page and how they work. In addition we learned the concepts of agile
methologies (SCRUM, Kanban, etc.). Also, we were introduced to figma and learned how to use it, whe had to do a GYM web page with all its sections. Me
and my partner were given the members and assosiates page to do.

## WEEK 2
```
In the second week we learned about HTML, Git and GitHub. Here we had to recreate the landing page of the figma project only with the basic of HTML, no CSS. I edited a index.html with VS code using only the basics (titles, subtitles, paragraphs, lists, images, etc.) We had to create a repository in GitHub using Git pushing and uploading a root folder with the assets and the index.html file. Every time i made a change in the index i had to commit it. I did all this with the help of the recorded class and the the asynchronous material and of course of my classmates and tutors.
