# BaSP 2023. Week 1 and 2
Brief description of what was worked on the project in the Week 1 and 2

## WEEK 1 DESCRIPTION

In the first week we learned te basics of web developement, the sections of a web page and how they work. In addition we learned the concepts of agile
methologies (SCRUM, Kanban, etc.). Also, we were introduced to figma and learned how to use it, whe had to do a GYM web page with all its sections. Me
and my partner were given the members and assosiates section to do. 


Here is the finished [project](https://www.figma.com/file/qVvOSwgA0WmUkM7e2ygRIN/UI-kit-RR?node-id=1359-5527&t=AEKF5OJFiM5Ff9oM-0): 


## WEEK 2 DESCRIPTION

In the second week we learned about HTML, Git and GitHub. Here we had to recreate the landing page of the figma project only with the basic of HTML, no CSS. I edited a index.html with VS code using only the basics (titles, subtitles, paragraphs, lists, images, etc.) We had to create a repository in GitHub using Git pushing and uploading a root folder with the assets and the index.html file. Every time i made a change in the index i had to commit it. I did all this with the help of the recorded class and the the asynchronous material and of course of my classmates and tutors.



## INSTRUCTIONS

So, first things first here is a list of what we need to do to make this project.

- Download Git and install from [here](https://git-scm.com/)
- Create a account and start a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository
- Install [VSCode](visualstudio.com) or any other code editor
- Create a root folder to start git and create an assets folder
- Create an index.html and to edit it with our code editor
- Push everything with git so it can be uploaded and make changes to GitHub
- Commit important changes
- Create a README.md file like this one


After you have installed git and created a GitHub repository you have tu add all of your folders and files, the steps to do so and the commands to use are right there when you first create the repository.

The next steps to follow are first to start with the basic structure of HTML that you can do it with
```
html:5
```
This will auto complete the basic structure of an HTML document.

Following the landing page you have to recreate everything in order. First there have to be a title in the head:
```
<title>
<head>
```
And next there is the body, which contains everything, from text to images and links. Another thing that can never be missing is the header, which contains the main title and the main tag that indicates the main content of the landing page
```
<body>
<header>
<main>
<h1>
```

The h1 tag must be unique but there can be multiple h2 tags (up to h6).

Last but not least, a landing page always must contain a footer with all of the information (authorship, copyright, contact, etc.) Yo can have several elements in one document

```
<footer>
```

Now is up to us which tags and elements use, to recreate the landing page identically, always following a logical structure semantically and not missing any element. As it was clarified at the beginning, you only have to use HTML, no CSS, so the visuals and style don't matter.

Explained all this, another important thing is that you have to commit with Git every time important changes are made to the document, and push it to GitHub for the changes to be made.

The final step for this project is to create an README.md file, it's quite simple, so with guides and tutorials you won't have problems.
